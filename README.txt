The algorithm uses 1 file:

data.txt

Requirements:

In order to run the code without any changes, the aforementioned data set and the source code (knal.py) should be kept in the same folder/directory (for example on Desktop).

Moreover, matplotlib package is required for graphs; matplotlib package can be installed 
by typing the following in the command line (python3):

pip3 install matplotlib


Running the code:

Assuming the requirements are met, the code can be run directly from the command line
by typing:

python3 knal.py
